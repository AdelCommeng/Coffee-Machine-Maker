# Coffee-Machine-Maker
A real simulation of a Coffee Machine maker that you have at your work! The program prompts the user to choose their type of coffee, then it asks to enter your money and if sufficient, you get the coffee printed on the output terminal.

This is a great project to Object-Oriented Programming!
